# Introduction
DEXbot is a decentralized application that acts as a sidecar to your cryptocurrency wallet, allowing you to automate selling your tokens 24/7. DEXbot has cross chain compatibility and works with any EVM compatible blockchain, side-chain or Layer 2. 

Users can configure token settings like the amount of tokens to never to sell below, what price to never sell below, the minimum amount of tokens to sell during a transaction, the maximum amount of tokens to sell during a transaction and more! DEXbot takes the legwork and emotions out of selling your tokens so that you don't have to keep an eye on the charts.

DEXbot is designed to sell tokens without a negative impact on the token price by monitoring key stats and taking token health into consideration. DEXbot only sells directly after a buy transaction, allowing you to sell as the price goes up and without affecting the token health. This is great for whales as well as token developer/marketing wallets that are focused on keeping the token price healthy and growing.

Users can connect any cryptocurrency wallet (even cold storage wallets). DEXbot allows a user to connect multiple wallets at a time through a single client application, allowing you to automate as many wallets as you want across any supported chain. 

We are extremely focused on security and that is why we open sourced the DEXbot Client Application and have checksums for every release. You can check out the [source code](https://github.com/DEXbotLLC/DEXbot_Client/) and even compile the application binary yourself if you prefer. We built the client application so that is easy to read with comments on every line so even if you are not a developer, you can read through the code. To use DEXbot, a user will need to enter their private key on their local machine but **it is very important to note that DEXbot never retrieves, stores, transmits, or logs your private key**. The DEXbot application is local to your computer, has no persistence and all data is destroyed after the program is terminated.
